# Hi, there!

I'm a senior undergraduate student studying physics and computer science at [BITS, Pilani - KK Birla Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/). My research is in the domain of high-energy physics where I'm interested in the developing machine learning algorithms to augment current data analysis techniques at the Large Hadron Collider.

If you want to chat, shoot me a message on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/ameyathete), or if you want to discuss my research or collaborate send me an email.
